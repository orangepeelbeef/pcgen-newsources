Like the Queen of Dis, whom many of them admire, these rangers take to heart the lessons they’ve learned from their vastly contrasting experiences and know that creatively embracing this wisdom is sometimes the difference between life and death.

SOURCEPAGE:p.22
## TODO Add bonuses for skills
Deceptive Subtlety							KEY:Realm Wanderer ~ Deceptive Subtlety										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RangerClassFeatures.RealmWandererClassFeatures.ExtraOrdinary.SpecialQuality																																																		DESC:A realm wanderer adds half his level (minimum 1) to Diplomacy checks to influence a creature’s attitude, to make requests of creatures, and for similar uses of the skill. He also adds half his level (minimum 1) to Bluff checks to deceive, lie, or convey secret messages.																																																																																																																																																									SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Queen's Bond								KEY:Realm Wanderer ~ Queen's Bond											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RangerClassFeatures.RealmWandererClassFeatures.ExtraOrdinary.SpecialQuality																																																		DESC:At 4th level, a realm wanderer must choose an animal companion for his hunter’s bond. This animal companion gains the fiendish template, likely either due to time it spent near a gate to Hell or due to infernal influences in its place of birth. Due to this insidious influence, this animal companion always takes a penalty on attack rolls equal to one-fifth of the realm wanderer’s level (minimum 1). If the realm wanderer releases his animal companion from service or it perishes, he can gain a new fiendish animal companion by completing the required ceremony. Alternatively, when the realm wanderer releases his animal companion or it dies in his service, he can use his influence over its fiendish nature to cause the animal to lose the fiendish template. If the animal companion is then raised or otherwise brought back from the dead after the realm wanderer removes its fiendish template, the animal companion no longer takes the penalty on attacks described above. (He cannot, however, gain a new non-fiendish animal companion by completing the ceremony to replace an animal companion.)																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Dual Master									KEY:Realm Wanderer ~ Dual Master											CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RangerClassFeatures.RealmWandererClassFeatures.ExtraOrdinary.SpecialQuality																																																		DESC:At 8th level, the realm wanderer’s bonuses from deceptive subtlety are doubled when he is in either of his two favored terrain types. However, this benefit applies only to the first two favored terrain types he selected; as he gains additional favored terrains at higher levels, this benefit does not apply in those additional terrain types.																																								SOURCEPAGE:p.22
Shrewdest Monarch							KEY:Realm Wanderer ~ Shrewdest Monarch										CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:RangerClassFeatures.RealmWandererClassFeatures.SuperNatural.SpecialQuality																																																		DESC:At 20th level, the realm wanderer has become a true master of the territories with which he is familiar. As a standard action, he can make a single attack at his full attack bonus against an enemy in one of the terrains chosen using the dual master ability. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or die. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half the realm wanderer’s level + his Wisdom modifier. A realm wanderer can instead deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the creature’s current hit points; the target can attempt a Fortitude save at the same DC to negates this damage. The realm wanderer can use this ability in these favored terrains only up to four times per day, but not against the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period. Further, the realm wanderer gains a bonus on attack rolls equal to his Wisdom modifier against creatures that have successfully learned his alignment (using detect chaos/evil/good/law, as appropriate, or similar effects).
